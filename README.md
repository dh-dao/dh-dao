### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a BOT that monitor and notify me about stock price and its indicators. Another project that i am doing is learning embedded programming on a STM32F3-Discovery Board, which has 2 MEMS and a few LEDs.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things, such as design pattern for embedded software, CI/CD and Unit-Tests in Embedded Software Development. Furthermore I want to learn in the future more about Cpp, Machine learning in Embedded (TinyML), Image Processing and so on.
